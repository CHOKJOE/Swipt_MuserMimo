multi-user MIMO relay by SWIPT, matlab file
## Description
This simulation system consists of single antenna source S (the number of source:N), multiple antenna DF relay R(the number of relay's antenna:L) and multiple antenna Destinaion D(the number of Destination's antenna). Relay R is battery-free and has harvesting energy capabilities. This means that received signal is used for relay and enrgy harvesting by Relay R.
